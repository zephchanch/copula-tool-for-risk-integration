# A Couplua Tool For Risk Integration - Capstone Final Year Project

The thesis investigates the use of copulas as a statistical model to describe the marginal and dependence structure of multi-variate risk probability distributions. 
Both bottom-up and top-down approaches are compared to simulate joint capital requirements for market risk and credit risk.  

We first implemented Monte Carlo simulations in Java based on market and credit risk loss distributions and then backtested our model with actual financial data through maximum likelihood estimation. 
We evaluated our models using Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).
